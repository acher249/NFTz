The organization of the Unity project is pretty straight forward. Lets keep things organized.

Currently there are two scenes, but can grow to be a bunch of them.

Things to do:
     - Bring in sound/music
     - Create new “Environments” that are different from the cube/box
     - Create library or smaller functions, that we can use and expand on to create new algoz.
     - Create whole new algoz, do whatever and have fun.
